This script demonstrates how to use Google BigQuery to query and analyze a public dataset, specifically the "hacker_news" dataset from the bigquery-public-data project.

Key Concepts
BigQuery Datasets: A collection of tables (e.g., the "hacker_news" dataset).
BigQuery Tables: Contain structured data (e.g., the "full" table within the "hacker_news" dataset).
Schema: Describes the structure of a table, including column names, data types, and constraints.

Purpose of the Script
Authenticate with BigQuery.
Explore the hacker_news dataset to understand its structure and available tables.
Fetch and analyze data efficiently by previewing rows and specific columns.

Why Do This?
This process is useful for:

Data Exploration: Understand the structure and contents of a dataset.
Analysis: Convert data into a Pandas DataFrame for advanced manipulation.
Efficiency: Use filters (e.g., selected_fields) to minimize data retrieval, reducing costs and improving performance.


- export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/Users/NadiaIT/Downloads/key.json"
    -- This command sets the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable to the path of the JSON key file for a Google Cloud Service Account.
    Why is this needed?
    BigQuery requires authentication to access datasets. The JSON file contains credentials that allow your script to interact securely with BigQuery.
    Without this step, the bigquery.Client() call will fail due to missing authentication.
